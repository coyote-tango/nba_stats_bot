Currently, nba_statsbot will bring the current stats (or last season stats for players that have not debuted in the 2017-18 season).

nba_statsbot is under constant improvement and in the future, it will bring more sophisticated stats (past season, historic players, career overalls, advanced, clutch, etc.).
